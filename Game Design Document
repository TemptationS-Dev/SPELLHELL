# SPELLHELL: Game Design Document
# Overview
SPELLHELL is a medieval-occult boss-only bullet hell featuring a mage protagonist who battles through a gauntlet of grotesque, ritual-bound monstrosities.
Combat emphasizes precision, dodge-heavy spell duels, tight arenas, and escalating magical patterns.

#Core Concept
A lone mage enters the infernal crucible known as SPELLHELL—an arcane trial forged by ancient covens. Each chamber presents a singular, overwhelming foe wielding violent patterns of magic.
Progression is earned through mastery, not grinding.
